# Tic-Tac-Toe AI 🤖

Think you can beat me? That’s cute.

You vs. this AI? Let’s be real—you’re bringing a water gun to a laser battle. This isn’t your average Tic-Tac-Toe opponent that falls for the old "corner trap" trick. Nope. This AI thinks ahead, calculates outcomes, and never blinks.

With Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) running under the hood, this bot is a cold, unfeeling machine of pure strategic dominance. You can try, but trust me—it doesn’t lose. At best, you’ll fight for a draw. At worst? Well… good luck finding where it buries your dignity.

🧠 What Makes This AI So OP?

Minimax Algorithm

The AI plays out every possible future move, so it’s never caught off guard.

Alpha-Beta Pruning

Cuts out the unnecessary calculations like a genius student speedrunning a math test. Same perfect result, but faster.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

Instead of brute-forcing every move, MCTS simulates thousands of possible futures and picks the best one, like Doctor Strange, but for Tic-Tac-Toe.

Basically, this AI is playing 4D chess while you’re struggling with a 3x3 grid

🚀 How to Play (aka How to Lose Gracefully)

Step 1: Accept your fate.

Step 2: Install Python 3+ (if you don’t already have it).

Step 3: Clone this mechanical menace from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/Sukh-Virk/TicTacToe.git  
cd TicTacToe  
python main.py  

Now, you can test your skills against the AI. Or, if you just want to watch two ultra-logical minds duke it out, you can run AI vs AI mode and witness the equivalent of a robot chess championship.

⚙️ System Requirements

Python 3+ (because we’re not coding in 1995).

If the AI is using MCTS, you might need NumPy:


pip install numpy  

🛠 Want to Try Cheating? Go Ahead.

If you think you can out-code this AI, fork the repo, tweak its logic, and submit a pull request. But fair warning—this AI doesn’t just play Tic-Tac-Toe, it plays mind games.
